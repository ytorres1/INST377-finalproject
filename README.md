# Project Title:
Pet Adoption Site
# Target Browsers:
My target browsers are iOS and Android. It can also be used in different types of browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and others. The site works for the most recent version of iOS, Android, and browsers. 
# Description of my project:
## API Used: 
Adoptable Pets from Montgomery County Animal Services and Adoption Center
https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/resource/e54u-qx42.json
## Visualizations Used:
A bar chart that shows the distribution of pet types such as dogs, cats, and others. Bar chart was made through using Chart.js
## Visualizations and JS Libraries:
I used Chart.js to make the bar chart shown on the site. 
## CSS Frameworks:
Flexbox was used to align the features on the site.
## Issue resolved by site:
Many pets go unseen because their characteristics sometimes are not as attractive as others so they don't get adopted. I would like to solve the issue of the pets not being adopted because the first thing people see are their features. My site creates a randomized list of pets without even knowing what type of animal it is and what their features are so the user is forced to look into a pet that they wouldn't have if they had looked at their features first.
